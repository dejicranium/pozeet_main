    This class affords a Pozeet client insight into metrics associated with a poll.

    Noteworthy is that these metrics can be diverse. Say a poll like the below exists:

    Who is going to win the 2019 presidential elections?
    -Buhari
    -Atiku
    -Durotoye

    To view insights, a user would have to choose a 'main-focus' and a 'sub-focus' when intending to view metrics.

    Example 1: a 'main focus' could be the Poll itself, and the subfocus might be 'gender'. That is:
        main_focus  = "Poll" 
        sub_focus = "Gender"

        Interpretation: the user wishes to see the gender distribution of the respondents of that poll. (She wants to know how many men
        compared to women voted in that poll)

    Example 2: the 'main focus' could be an Option, and the subfocust might be a demographic attribute such as 'age': That is:
        main_focus = 'Option:{option_id here}"
        sub_focus = 'Gender'

        So, using the above poll as an example, a user can decide to view metrics on the option "Buhari" by requesting insights to how many people within
        the age of 18-30 as compared to users within the ages groups: 31-40 and 41-50 who voted the option "Buhari"
    
    Example 3: the 'main_focus' could be a demographic criterion such as locatoin and the 'sub focus' SHALL BE 'options'. Using the example poll, 
        a user could decide to see how many people in Lagos who voted Buhari as compared to the number of people in Lagos who will vote Buhari and Durotoye
    

    This is so much fun if you ask me, :-)
